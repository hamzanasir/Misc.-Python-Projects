#> Man in Black: All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has begun.
#  It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is right... and who is dead.

#The line above is from the perennial favorite 1980s movie adaptation of William Goldman's *The Princess Bride*, wherein a mysterious
# hero sits down to a battle of wits with a villainous Sicilian kidnapper. The setup: two cups positioned between the two, one of which
# (purportedly) contains a colorless, odorless, lethal poison (viz., iocane powder). After a guess is made as to which cup contains the
# poison, both drink, and the winner is the one left standing.

#The following program simulates multiple rounds of this battle of wits, allowing the player to repeatedly guess
#  which cup is poisoned. The computer will "place" the poison before the player guesses, and will reveal who is right... and who is dead, afterwards.

#At the outset, the computer will always place the poison in cup 2 before letting the player guess, but after enough guesses have been entered
#  the computer will start to place the poison based on the pattern of previous guesses so as to outsmart the player.
